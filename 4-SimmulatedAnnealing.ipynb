    "Por tanto, inicialmente en el algoritmo se busca un estado inicial que s eescoge de manera al azar y se establece un valor máximo y mínimo de temperatura del modelo.\n",

    "Una vez arrancamos el algoritmo:\n",
    "* 1- se evalua el coste del modelo en el estado actual, donde el coste es una función escogida, que permita evaluar el estado.\n",
    "* 2- se calcula el siguiente vecino, es decir, el siguiente posible estado. La busqueda de este nuevo estado se calcula de maneras diferentes dependiendo del problema que se quiera resolver, pero en todos los casos, este calculco de busqueda del vecino depende directamente de la Temperatura que tenga el modelo en dicho momento. A mayor temperatura, la busqueda de este vecino es más aleatorio, es decir, puede que este más lejos, pero, en caso de que se vaya enfriando la temperatura (como en el problema de la metalurgia) este vecino cada vez es más cerco al estado anterior, convergiendo así el problema.\n",
    "* 3- Una vez obtenido este vecino, se calcula el coste que supone estar en este nuevo estado\n",
    "* 4- Con el coste del nuevo vecino y el anterior, se les calcula la diferencia, y si el nuevo coste es mejor, inferior, al anterior, se acepta este nuevo estado. Pero en caso de que no sea una mejor solución este nuevo estado solo es aceptado en el caso de que se cumpla la siguiente condición $e^{(\\Delta E/T)}>rand(0,1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Por tanto, en el caso de que estamos en un caso peor, esto se aceptará solo en el caso de que se cumpla la condición anterior. Es decir, en el momento en el que dicha expresión sea mayor al valor aleatorio de $rand(0,,1)$, que esto se cumple con más facilidad al principio del algoritmo en el momento en el que $\\Delta E<0$ y la $T$ es muy alta, resultado en un valor de $e^{(\\Delta E/T)}$ muy cercano a 1, por tanto hay altas probabilidades de que sea mayor al valor aleatorio de rand(0,1) y se acepte este nueve estado, aunque sea peor, pero esto puede evitar que nos estanquemos en un máximo local. Mientras que por otro lado, en el caso de que  $\\Delta E<0$ y la $T$ es baja, el valor resultante de $e^{(\\Delta E/T)}$ este es muy bajo, cercano a 0 y tiene más complicado que se acepte este nuevo estado."
