    "As previously mentioned, we will be utilizing the Airbus Aircraft database, which features high-resolution satellite images, each measuring 2560x2560 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, according to the documentation on the YOLO library's GitHub page, the latest models in this library are not capable of processing images larger than 640 pixels. Consequently, in this section of our project, we have decided to divide the image in subimages, i.e., instead of having one picture of 2560x2560 there is gonna be 25 subimages of 512x512 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we are using the YOLO files, we do not only need to make the image divisionwe also need to prepare the files for those subimages."

    "There are many versions of YOLO, but we will focus on YOLOv8, which are the latest versions offered. Additionally, within YOLOv8, there are several models that have been pre-trained for Detection, Segmentation, and Pose with different databases. Among the different databases used, it's worth highlighting COCO (Common Objects in Context), Open Image V7 (with Google Images), and ImageNet, each of which includes labeled images [6].\n",
    "Focusing exclusively on YOLOv8 pre-trained with COCO, we need to choose a model size that is suitable for the problem at hand. The following table shows a summary of the main characteristics of the different models. Notable features include the pixel size that the model supports, params which is the number of parameters the model has in millions (a higher number of parameters can be more complex and effective, but slower), and lastly FLOPs (Floating Point Operations Per Second) representing the model's complexity.\n"
